??? Decrease primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense, a one-time charge for financing-related fees and an increase in 
income tax expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, as discussed in detail below. 
 
 
GMV – GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was 
RMB787 billion (US$127 billion), an increase of 49% compared to the same quarter of 2013, and compared 
to RMB556 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, representing a net addition of RMB231 billion 
GMV in three months. GMV transacted on Taobao Marketplace in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was 
RMB494 billion (US$80 billion), an increase of 43% compared to the same quarter of 2013.  GMV 
transacted on Tmall in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB293 billion (US$47 billion), an 
increase of 60% compared to the same quarter of 2013. The GMV growth was primarily driven by an 
increase in the number of active buyers and also partially attributable to category expansion, for example, 
auction transactions. On November 11, 2014, our Singles Day promotion generated GMV settled through 
Alipay of RMB57 billion (US$9.2 billion) on our China and international retail marketplaces within a 24-
hour period, an increase of 58% compared to the Singles Day in 2013. 
 
Mobile GMV – Mobile GMV in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB327 billion (US$53 billion), 
an increase of 213% compared to the same quarter of 2013. Mobile GMV accounted for 42% of total GMV 
transacted on our China retail marketplaces in this quarter, compared to 36% in the quarter ended September 
30, 2014 and 20% in the same quarter of 2013. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in the 
monthly active users accessing our platforms through mobile devices and an increase in the level of their 
spending. 
 
3 
 
 
Annual active buyers – Our China retail marketplaces had 334 million annual active buyers in the twelve 
months ended December 31, 2014, compared to 307 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 
and 231 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of 45% compared 
to the same period in 2013.  The growth in annual active buyers was driven by an increase in active buyers 
throughout China, with substantially faster growth from lower tier cities. 
 
Mobile MAUs – Mobile MAUs grew to 265 million in the month ended December 31, 2014, compared to 
217 million in the month ended September 30, 2014, representing a record high net addition of 48 million 
MAUs in three months, and a 95% increase from 136 million in the month ended December 31, 2013. 
According to iResearch, our Mobile Taobao App continues to be the No. 1 e-commerce app in China, 
demonstrating our ability to attract mobile users with strong purchasing intent on a large scale. 
 
Revenue – Revenue increased by 40% to RMB26,179 million (US$4,219 million) in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2014, compared to RMB18,745 million in the same quarter of 2013.  Revenue from the China 
commerce retail business increased by 32% to RMB21,275 million (US$3,429 million), compared to 
RMB16,149 million in the same quarter of 2013, mainly driven by the growth in commission revenue and 
online marketing services revenue. Mobile revenue from the China commerce retail business increased by 
448% to RMB6,420 million (US$1,035 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to 
RMB1,171 million in the same quarter of 2013, primarily due to a greater proportion of GMV generated on 
mobile devices and an increase in the mobile monetization rate. 
 
Income from operations – Income from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB9,347 
million (US$1,506 million), an increase of 6% compared to RMB8,801 million in the same quarter of 2013. 
Operating income growth was lower than revenue growth primarily due to an increase in share-based 
compensation expense (as discussed in “Share-based compensation expense” below). 
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA – Non-GAAP EBITDA increased by 34% to RMB15,103 million (US$2,434 million) 
in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to RMB11,246 million in the same quarter of 2013.  
Non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 58% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to 60% in the 
December quarter of 2013. The year-on-year decrease in non-GAAP EBITDA margin was primarily due to 
the consolidation of newly acquired businesses, mainly UCWeb Inc., or UCWeb, and AutoNavi Holding 
Limited, or AutoNavi, and investments in new business initiatives, such as our mobile operating system, 
local services and digital entertainment. The quarter-on-quarter increase in non-GAAP EBITDA margin from 
51% in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was primarily due to operating leverage in this seasonally 
strong quarter. 
 
Net income – Our net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB5,983 million (US$964 
million), a decrease of 28% compared to RMB8,357 million in the same quarter of 2013. The decrease was 
primarily due to (i) an increase in share-based compensation expense (including the effect of “mark-to-
market” accounting of share-based awards in an amount of RMB1,494 million (US$241 million)) (as 
discussed in “Share-based compensation expense” below), (ii) an RMB830 million (US$134 million) one-
time charge for financing-related fees as a result of the early repayment of our US$8 billion bank borrowings 
(as discussed in “Interest expense” below), and (iii) an increase in income tax expenses, primarily due to the 
expiration of an enterprise income tax (“EIT”) exemption period for one of our major subsidiaries (as 
discussed in “Income tax expenses” below).  
 
Non-GAAP net income – Non-GAAP net income increased by 25% to RMB13,115 million (US$2,114 
million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to RMB10,463 million in the same quarter of 
2013. 
 
4 
 
 
Diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS – Diluted EPS in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was 
RMB2.29 (US$0.37) on 2,588 million diluted shares outstanding, a decrease of 35% compared to RMB3.55 
on 2,343 million diluted shares outstanding in the same quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP diluted EPS in the 
quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB5.05 (US$0.81) on 2,588 million diluted shares outstanding, an 
increase of 13% compared to RMB4.45 on 2,343 million diluted shares outstanding in the same quarter of 
2013.  The lower non-GAAP diluted EPS growth rate relative to non-GAAP net income growth rate was due 
to an increase in number of diluted shares outstanding in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 following the 
completion of our initial public offering in September 2014.  
 
December Quarter Financial Results  
 
Revenue – Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB26,179 million  (US$4,219 million), 
an increase of 40% compared to RMB18,745 million in the same quarter of 2013.  The increase was mainly 
driven by the continuing rapid growth of our China commerce retail business. The following table sets forth 
a breakdown of our revenue for the periods indicated.

? China commerce retail business – Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2014 was RMB21,275 million (US$3,429 million), or 82% of total revenue, an 
increase of 32% compared to RMB16,149 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was mainly 
driven by the growth in commission revenue and online marketing services revenue. Commission 
revenue accounted for 37% of China commerce retail revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, 
compared to 30% in the same quarter of 2013. Revenue growth during this period occurred in the context 
of and reflected an increase of 49% in GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces, which was 
primarily driven by a 45% increase in the number of active buyers.   
 
The lower revenue growth relative to GMV growth was mainly a result of (i) the higher percentage of 
total GMV contributed by mobile GMV, which has a lower monetization rate compared to the non-
mobile monetization rate, and (ii) lower pay-for-performance (“P4P”) monetization on the personal 
computer (“PC”) interface compared to the same quarter of 2013.  The lower P4P monetization on PC 
was primarily caused by our continued efforts to improve user experience, which adversely affected cost 
per click.  Our strong momentum in mobile and commitment to improving user experience may slow the 
growth rate of our online marketing services revenue in the near term, but we believe they will create 
significant value for both our users and our business in the longer term.

Mobile revenue from the China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was 
RMB6,420 million (US$1,035 million), an increase of 448% compared to RMB1,171 million in the same 
quarter of 2013, representing 30% of our China commerce retail business revenue, compared to 29% in 
the quarter ended September 30, 2014 and 7% in the same quarter of 2013.  The increase in mobile 
revenue from the China commerce retail business was primarily due to a greater proportion of GMV 
generated on mobile devices and an increase in the mobile monetization rate.  
 
? China commerce wholesale business – Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the 
quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB860 million (US$139 million), an increase of 41% compared 
to RMB612 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was due to an increase in average revenue 
from paying members and an increase in paying members.        
 
? International commerce retail business – Revenue from our international commerce retail business in 
the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB554 million (US$89 million), an increase of 110% 
compared to RMB264 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase 
in GMV transacted on AliExpress, partially attributable to AliExpress’ participation in our Singles Day 
promotion campaign on November 11, 2014 for the first time.  
 
? International commerce wholesale business – Revenue from our international commerce wholesale 
business in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB1,209 million (US$195 million), an increase 
of 21% compared to RMB1,000 million in the same quarter of 2013. The main reason for this increase 
was an increase in the number of paying members and an increase in average revenue from paying 
members.    
 
? Others – Other revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB1,919 million (US$309 
million), an increase of 266% compared to RMB524 million in the same quarter of 2013. This increase 
was primarily due to the consolidation of revenue from acquired business (mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi) 
and an increase in interest income generated by our SME loan business.  When the restructuring of our 
relationship with Ant Financial closes, which we expect in the March 2015 quarter, we will no longer 
consolidate revenue generated by the SME loan business in our financial results.  
 
Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB7,520 million 
(US$1,212 million), or 29% of revenue, compared to RMB4,171 million, or 22% of revenue, in the same 
quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense (as 
discussed in “Share-based compensation expense” below), an increase in costs associated with our new 
businesses initiatives, and an increase in payment processing fees resulting from an increase in GMV 
transacted on our retail marketplaces.   
 
Product development expenses – Product development expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 
were RMB3,083 million (US$497 million), or 12% of revenue, compared to RMB1,707 million, or 9% of 
revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based 
compensation expense (as discussed in “Share-based compensation expense” below).  The increase was 
partially offset by the decrease in royalty fees paid to Yahoo which terminated upon completion of our initial 
public offering in September 2014. 
 
Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 
were RMB3,021 million (US$487 million), or 12% of revenue, compared to RMB1,897 million, or 10% of 
revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based 
compensation expense (as discussed in “Share-based compensation expense” below). The increase was also 
6 
 
 
due to the consolidation of marketing expenses of acquired business (mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi), an 
increase in advertising and promotional spending mainly to strengthen marketing of our Taobao and Tmall 
brands, especially in lower tier cities, as well as to promote our new businesses initiatives (e.g., local services) 
during this quarter. 
 
General and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2014 were RMB2,419 million (US$390 million), or 9 % of revenue, compared to RMB2,046 
million, or 11% of revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The decrease in general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a one-time equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 
million made in the quarter ended December 31, 2013 relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 
of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization, which was partially offset by an increase in share-based 
compensation expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 (as discussed in “Share-based compensation 
expense” below). 
 
Share-based compensation expense – Share-based compensation expense included in respective cost or 
expense items above in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB4,313 million (US$695 million), or 
16% of revenue, an increase of 554% compared to RMB659 million, or 4% of revenue, in the same quarter 
of 2013. The increase was primarily caused by (1) performance-based and retention grants of share-based 
awards granted prior to our initial public offering in 2014, with vesting periods of four years for our 
employees and six years for senior management, (2) the “mark-to-market” accounting of (i) share-based 
awards we granted to the employees of Zhejiang Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Company Ltd., or 
Ant Financial, and (ii) Ant Financial’s share-based awards granted by a major shareholding entity of Ant 
Financial controlled by Jack Ma, our executive chairman, to our employees. The expense arising from such 
Ant Financial share-based awards granted to our employees represents a non-cash accounting charge to us 
that will not result in any equity dilution to our shareholders. Without the effect of such “mark-to-market” 
accounting, our share-based compensation expense would have been RMB2,819 million (US$454 million) in 
the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to RMB2,233 million in the quarter ended September 30, 
2014. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to perform 
such re-measurement at each period end. Accordingly, we expect that our share-based compensation expense 
will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of our share-based awards as well as the fair value of 
Ant Financial’s share-based awards granted to our employees. 
 
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended December 31, 
2014 was RMB614 million (US$99 million), a significant increase from RMB123 million in the same 
quarter of 2013. This increase was due to an increase in intangibles assets primarily as a result of our 
strategic acquisitions, mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi. 
 
Income from operations – Income from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB9,347 
million (US$1,506 million), an increase of 6% compared to RMB8,801 million in the same quarter of 2013. 
The lower growth of operating income relative to revenue growth in this quarter and the decrease in 
operating margin to 36% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 from 47% in the same quarter of 2013 
were primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense (as discussed in “Share-based 
compensation expense” above). 
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA – Non-GAAP EBITDA increased by 34% to RMB15,103 million (US$2,434 million) 
in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to RMB11,246 million in the same quarter of 2013.  
Non-GAAP EBITDA margin was 58% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to 60% in the 
December quarter of 2013. The year-on-year decrease in non-GAAP EBITDA margin was primarily due to 
the consolidation of newly acquired businesses, mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi, and investments in new 
business initiatives, such as our mobile operating system, local services and digital entertainment. The 
7 
 
 
quarter-on-quarter increase in non-GAAP EBITDA margin from 51% in the quarter ended September 30, 
2014 was primarily due to operating leverage in this seasonally strong quarter. A reconciliation of operating 
income to non-GAAP EBITDA is included at the end of this release.  
 
Interest and investment income, net – Interest and investment income, net in the quarter ended December 
31, 2014 was RMB313 million (US$51 million), an increase of 6% compared to RMB296 million in the 
same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher 
cash balance during the period, which in turn was primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public 
offering in September 2014 and an increase in operating cash flow. This increase was partially offset by an 
increase in impairment charge of cost-method investments and losses recognized with respect to the periodic 
revaluation of convertible bonds we held in connection with our strategic investments in publicly traded 
entities. 
 
Interest expense – Interest expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB1,344 million 
(US$216 million), an increase of 247% compared to RMB387 million in the same quarter of 2013. The 
increase was primarily due to an RMB830 million (US$134 million) one-time charge for financing-related 
fees as a result of the early repayment of our US$8 billion bank borrowings with proceeds from our issuance 
of US$8 billion senior unsecured notes in this quarter. 
 
Other income, net – Other income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB901 million 
(US$145 million), an increase of 64% compared to RMB548 million in the same quarter of 2013. The 
increase was primarily due to an increase of RMB101 million (US$16 million) in royalty fees and software 
technology service fees received from Ant Financial to RMB344 million (US$55 million) in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2014 from RMB243 million in the same quarter of 2013 as a result of an increase in 
pre-tax income of Ant Financial, as well as an increase in government grants received from central and local 
governments in connection with our contribution to technology development and investments in local 
business districts. 
 
Income tax expenses – Income tax expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 were RMB2,429 
million (US$392 million), an increase of 228% compared to RMB741 million in the same quarter of 2013. 
The increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income from our operations in China. Our effective 
tax rate increased to 26% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 from 8% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, 
and unrealized gain/loss on investments which are not deductible or assessable for income tax purposes, our 
effective tax rate would have been 17% in the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared to 7% in the 
same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of an EIT exemption period for one of 
our major subsidiaries, upon which the subsidiary became subject to an EIT rate of 12.5% (or 50% of the 
statutory EIT rate) in calendar year 2014.  
 
Net income and non-GAAP net income – As a result of the foregoing, our net income in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2014 was RMB5,983 million (US$964 million), a decrease of 28% compared to RMB8,357 
million in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding the effects of share-based compensation expense, impairment 
of goodwill and investment in equity investees, the one-time charge for financing-related fees, amortization 
of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 
was RMB13,115 million (US$2,114 million), an increase of 25% compared to RMB10,463 million in the 
same quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this 
release. 
 
8 
 
 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders – Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in 
the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB5,936 million (US$957million), a decrease of 28% compared 
to RMB8,266 million in the same quarter of 2013.   
 
Diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS – Diluted EPS in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was 
RMB2.29 (US$0.37) on 2,588 million diluted shares outstanding, a decrease of 35% compared to RMB3.55 
on 2,343 million diluted shares outstanding in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding the effects of share-based 
compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and investment in equity investees, the one-time charge for 
financing-related fees, amortization of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted EPS in 
the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was RMB5.05 (US$0.81), an increase of 13% compared to RMB4.45 
in the same quarter of 2013. The lower non-GAAP diluted EPS relative to non-GAAP net income growth 
rate was due to an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding in the quarter ended December 31, 
2014 following the completion of our initial public offering. A reconciliation of diluted EPS to the non-

the date of this press release and are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date,

under applicable law. 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 
To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with 
GAAP, Alibaba Group uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP EBITDA (including 
non-GAAP EBITDA margin), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash flow. For more 
information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of 
Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” in this press release.    
Alibaba Group believes that non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS help 
identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that 
Alibaba Group includes in income from operations, net income and diluted EPS. Alibaba Group believes that 
non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about 
its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and 
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and 
operational decision-making. Alibaba Group considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides 
useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by its business that can 
be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in its new business initiatives, making 
strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening its balance sheet. Non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP 
net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as 
an alternative to net income, diluted EPS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator 
of Alibaba Group’s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate 
similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. 
 
Non-GAAP EBITDA represents income from operations (which excludes interest and investment income, 
net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before 
certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation and 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and an equity-settled donation expense that Alibaba Group 
does not believe are reflective of its core operating performance during the periods presented.   
 
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization, 
impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain (loss) on deemed 
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the 
restructuring of commercial arrangements with Ant Financial, and one-time expense items consisting of the 
11 
 
 
expenses relating to the sale of shares by existing shareholders in our initial public offering, equity-settled 
donation expense and charge for financing-related fees as a result of early repayment of bank borrowings. 
  
Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including 
accounting for the effects of the assumed conversion of convertible preference shares.  
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in Alibaba Group’s 
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets (excluding 
acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress) and adjusted for changes in loan receivables 
relating to micro loans of its SME loan business. Alibaba Group presents the adjustment for changes in loan 
receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the 
secured borrowings and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from 
financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net 
of the effect of changes in loan receivables. 
 
The tables captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” 
in this press release has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable 
to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
