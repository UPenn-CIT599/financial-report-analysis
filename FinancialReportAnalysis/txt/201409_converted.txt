an increase of 53.7% compared to RMB10,950 million in the same quarter of 2013.  The increase was mainly 
driven by the continuing rapid growth of our China commerce retail business.  
• China commerce retail business – Revenue from China commerce retail business in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2014 was RMB12,769 million (US$2,080 million), or 75.9% of total revenue, an increase 
of 47.7% compared to RMB8,645 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was mainly driven 
by the growth in online marketing services revenue and commission revenue. Commission revenue 
accounted for 33.5% of China commerce retail revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, 
compared to 24.8% in the same quarter of 2013. Revenue growth during this period occurred in the 
context of and reflected an increase of 48.7% in GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces, which 
was primarily driven by a 52.0% increase in the number of active buyers. Monetization rate remained 
stable at 2.30% in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, compared to 2.31% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Mobile revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB3,719 million (US$606 million), 
representing 29.1% of China commerce retail business revenue, compared to 19.4% in the quarter ended 
June 30, 2014 and 3.8% in the same quarter of 2013. Mobile revenue increased as a result of increased

• China commerce wholesale business – Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the 
quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB790 million (US$129 million), an increase of 39.1% 
compared to RMB568 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase in revenue was due to an 
increase in paying members and an increase in average revenue from paying members.        
• International commerce retail business – Revenue from our international commerce retail business in 
the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB419 million (US$68 million), nearly doubling from 
RMB210 million in the same quarter of 2013. The main reason for this increase was an increase in GMV 
transacted on AliExpress. 
• International commerce wholesale business – Revenue from our international commerce wholesale 
business in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB1,198 million (US$195 million), an increase 
of 24.0% compared to RMB966 million in the same quarter of 2013. The main reason for this increase 
was an increase in the number of paying members.    
Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB5,596 million 
(US$912 million), or 33.3% of revenue, compared to RMB3,001 million, or 27.4% of revenue, in the same 
quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in share-based compensation expense 
caused by the re-measurement at period end to fair value of share-based awards granted to the employees of 
Zhejiang Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Company, Ltd., or Ant Financial, and (ii) an increase in 
co-location, bandwidth and depreciation expenses as a result of our investments in Alibaba Cloud Computing 
and our data platform.   
 
Product development expenses – Product development expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 
were RMB2,581 million (US$421 million), or 15.3% of revenue, compared to RMB1,168 million, or 10.7% 
5 
 
 
of revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefit 
expense including share-based compensation expense.  Our product development headcount increased as we 
continue to focus on new and existing product development and as a result of our acquisitions of UCWeb and 
AutoNavi. 
Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 
were RMB1,749 million (US$285 million), or 10.4% of revenue, compared to RMB657 million, or 6.0% of 
revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in tactical advertising and 
promotional spending mainly to promote our China retail marketplaces during this quarter when intense 
global interest in Alibaba enhanced the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Additionally, the 
consolidation of marketing expense in acquired businesses, including UCWeb and AutoNavi, and an increase 
in promoting new business initiatives (including local services and digital entertainment) also contributed to 
the increase of sales and marketing expenses in this quarter. 
General and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2014 were RMB1,960 million (US$319 million), or 11.6% of revenue, compared to RMB793 
million, or 7.2% of revenue in the same quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in 
share-based compensation expense.  
Share-based compensation expense –  Share-based compensation expense included in respective cost or 
expense items above in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB3,010 million (US$490 million), or 
17.9% of revenue, an increase of 248.4% compared to RMB864 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in the same 
quarter of 2013.  Share-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenue increased due to 
performance-based and retention grants of share-based awards to our employees and members of executive 
management prior to our initial public offering, with vesting periods ranging from four to six years, as well 
as the re-measurement charge relating to share-based awards granted to the employees of Ant Financial as 
described under Cost of Revenue above. 
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended September 30, 
2014 was RMB598 million (US$97 million), a significant increase from RMB39 million in the same quarter 
of 2013. The increase was primarily related to the strategic acquisitions, including UCWeb and AutoNavi. 
Income from operations– Income from operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB4,345 
million (US$708 million), or 25.8% of revenue, a decrease of 17.2% compared to RMB5,248 million, or 
47.9% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in share-based 
compensation expense and an increase in amortization of intangible assets.  
Non-GAAP EBITDA – Non-GAAP EBITDA increased by 30.6% to RMB8,493 million (US$1,384 million) 
in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, compared to RMB6,505 million in the same quarter of 2013.  Non-
GAAP EBITDA margin was 50.5% in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. This was a decrease from 
59.4% in the September quarter of 2013 and from 54.4% in the June quarter of 2014. The decrease in non-
GAAP EBITDA margin was primarily due to (i) the consolidation of newly acquired businesses, mainly 
including UCWeb and AutoNavi, (ii) planned investments in new business initiatives, such as our mobile 
operating system, local services and digital entertainment, and (iii) increased tactical marketing spending 
during the September quarter. A reconciliation of income from operations to non-GAAP EBITDA is 
included at the end of this release.

Interest and investment income, net – Interest and investment income, net in the quarter ended September 
30, 2014 was RMB468 million (US$76 million), an increase of 47.2% compared to RMB318 million in the 
same quarter of 2013. The increase in net interest and investment income was primarily due to a net gain 
recognized with respect to the revaluation of previously held equity interests relating to the merger of 
AutoNavi, and an increase in interest income as a result of higher cash balance during the period, partially 
offset by losses recognized with respect to the revaluation of convertible bonds in connection with our 
strategic investments in publicly traded entities.  
Interest expense – Interest expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB521 million (US$85 
million), an increase of 39.3% compared to RMB374 million in the same quarter of 2013. The increase in 
interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average loan amount outstanding during the period 
following the drawdown in April 2014 of the remaining US$3.0 billion under a US$8.0 billion credit facility.    
Other income, net – Other income, net in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB378 million 
(US$62 million), a decrease of 2.8% compared to RMB389 million in the same quarter of 2013. For the 
quarter ended September 30, 2014, other income, net, primarily included royalty fees and software 
technology service fees received from Ant Financial which increased to RMB430 million (US$70 million) in 
the quarter ended September 30, 2014 from RMB204 million in the same quarter of 2013, and RMB195 
million of expenses relating to the sale of shares by existing shareholders in our initial public offering. 
Income tax expenses – Income tax expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 were RMB1,339 
million (US$218 million), an increase of 110.2% compared to RMB637 million in the same quarter of 2013. 
The increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income from our operations in China. Our effective 
tax rate increased to 28.7% in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 from 11.4% in the same quarter of 2013. 
Excluding share-based compensation expense which is not deductible for income tax purposes, and gain on 
revaluation of investments which are not subject to income tax, our effective tax rate would have been 17.6% 
in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, compared to 9.9% in the same quarter of 2013. Such increase was 
primarily because the enterprise income tax, or EIT, exemption period of one of our major subsidiaries 
expired and such subsidiary became subject to an EIT rate of 12.5% (or 50% of the statutory EIT rate) in 
calendar year 2014.  
Net income and non-GAAP net income – As a result of the foregoing, our net income in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2014 was RMB3,030 million (US$494 million), a decrease of 38.6% compared to RMB4,937 
million in the same quarter of 2013.  Excluding the effects of share-based compensation expense, 
amortization of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended 
September 30, 2014 was RMB6,808 million (US$1,109 million), an increase of 15.5% compared to 
RMB5,893 million in the same quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is 
included at the end of this release. 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders – Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in 
the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB2,976 million (US$485 million), a decrease of 39.1% 
compared to RMB4,883 million in the same quarter of 2013.   
Diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS – Diluted EPS in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was 
RMB1.24 (US$0.20) on 2,438 million diluted shares outstanding, a decrease of 41.8% compared to 
RMB2.13 on 2,317 million diluted shares outstanding in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding the effects of 
7 
 
 
share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and certain other items, non-GAAP 
diluted EPS in the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was RMB2.79 (US$0.45), an increase of 9.4% 
compared to RMB2.55 in the same quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of diluted EPS to the non-GAAP diluted 
EPS is included at the end of this release.

million), an increase of 33.7% compared to RMB6,683 million in the same quarter of 2013. A reconciliation 
of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, the non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is 
included at the end of this release.

investments in Alibaba’s business; risks associated with acquisitions; privacy and regulatory concerns; 
competition; security breaches; the continued growth of the e-commerce market in China and globally; and 
fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China and globally and assumptions underlying 
or related to any of the foregoing.  Further information regarding these and other risks is included in 
Alibaba’s filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of 
the date of this press release and are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date, 
and Alibaba does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required 
under applicable law. 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with 
GAAP, Alibaba Group uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP EBITDA (including 
non-GAAP EBITDA margin), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash flow. For more 
information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table captioned “Reconciliations of 
Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” in this press release.    
Alibaba Group believes that non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS help 
identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that 
Alibaba Group includes in income from operations, net income and diluted EPS. Alibaba Group believes that 
non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about 
its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and 
allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and 
operational decision-making. Alibaba Group considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides 
useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by its business that can 
be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in its new business initiatives, making 
strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening its balance sheet. Non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP 
net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as 
an alternative to net income, diluted EPS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator 
of Alibaba Group’s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be 
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate 
similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. 
Non-GAAP EBITDA represents income from operations (which excludes interest and investment income, 
net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before 
certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation and 
10 
 
 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that Alibaba Group does not believe are reflective of its core 
operating performance during the periods presented.   
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization, 
impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain (loss) on deemed 
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the 
restructuring of commercial arrangement with Ant Financial, and a one-time expense item consisting of the 
expenses relating to the sale of shares by existing shareholders in our initial public offering.  
  
Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including 
accounting for the effects of the assumed conversion of convertible preference shares.  
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in Alibaba Group’s 
consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets (excluding 
acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress) and adjusted for changes in loan receivables 
relating to micro loans of its SME loan business. Alibaba Group presents the adjustment for changes in loan 
receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the  
secured borrowings and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from 
financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net 
of the effect of changes in loan receivables. 
 
The tables captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” 
in this press release has more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable 
to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
