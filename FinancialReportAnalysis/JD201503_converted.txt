actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the reader. The conversion of 
Renminbi (RMB) into USD in this press release is based on the noon buying rate in The City of New York for

and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions from net loss, and non-
GAAP net margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) by net revenues. See “Reconciliation 
of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this press release.

First Quarter 2015 Financial Results 
GMV and Net Revenues.  GMV for the first quarter of 2015 was RMB87.8 billion (US$14.2 billion), up 99% 
from the first quarter of 2014. GMV from the online direct sales and online marketplace businesses totaled 
RMB50.9 billion and RMB36.9 billion, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 63% and 185%, 
respectively, from the first quarter of 2014. GMV from electronics and home appliance products was RMB44.4 
billion in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 65% from the first quarter of 2014, while GMV from general 
merchandise and others was RMB43.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 152% from the first 
quarter of 2014. As a percentage of total GMV, GMV from general merchandise and others increased to 49.4% 
in the first quarter of 2015 from 39.1% in the first quarter of 2014. 
For the first quarter of 2015, JD.com reported net revenues of RMB36.6 billion (US$5.9 billion), representing 
a 62% increase from the same period in 2014. The increases in GMV and net revenues were primarily due to 
the growth in active customer accounts and the number of fulfilled orders in the first quarter of 2015. Net 
revenues from online direct sales increased by 59%, while net revenues from services and others increased by 
139% in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to the increased 
revenues from the Company’s rapidly expanding online marketplace and advertising services. 
Cost of Revenues.  Cost of revenues increased by 58% to RMB32.2 billion (US$5.2 billion) in the first quarter 
of 2015 from RMB20.4 billion in the first quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the growth of the 
Company’s direct sales business and the increased traffic acquisition costs directly related to the online 
marketing services provided to merchants and suppliers.  
Fulfillment Expenses.  Fulfillment expenses, which primarily include procurement, warehousing, delivery 
and customer service expenses, increased by 97% to RMB2.7 billion (US$0.4 billion) in the first quarter of 
2015 from RMB1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the expansion of 
delivery services provided to merchants on the Company’s marketplace and the expansion of the Company’s 
fulfillment infrastructure to smaller cities. 
Marketing Expenses.  Marketing expenses increased by 140% to RMB1.4 billion (US$0.2 billion) in the first 
quarter of 2015 from RMB0.6 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP marketing expenses4 increased 
by 89% to RMB1.1 billion (US$0.2 billion) in the first quarter of 2015 from RMB0.6 billion in the first quarter 
of 2014. The increase of non-GAAP marketing expenses was primarily due to the increased brand advertising 
and other online marketing activities during the Chinese Spring festival. 
Technology and Content Expenses.  Technology and content expenses increased by 147% to RMB704.4 
million (US$113.6 million) in the first quarter of 2015 from RMB285.0 million in the first quarter of 2014. This 
increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of technology employees, which included the addition 
of research and development talent after the Tencent transaction in March 2014, as well as senior technology 
employees hired to continuously improve the Company’s mobile and big data technologies. 
General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses decreased to RMB479.9 million 
(US$77.4 million) in the first quarter of 2015 from RMB3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2014 due to certain 
special share-based compensation in the prior year period. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses4 
increased by 82% to RMB353.5 million (US$57.0 million) in the first quarter of 2015 from RMB194.0 million 
in the first quarter of 2014. The increase of non-GAAP general and administrative expenses was generally in 
line with our expanded scale of operations. 
                                                          
4 As used in this press release, non-GAAP operating expenses are defined to exclude share-based compensation 
and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions from operating expenses. 
See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” at the end of this press release.

Net Loss and Non-GAAP Net Loss.  Net loss for the first quarter of 2015 was RMB710.2 million (US$114.6 
million), compared to RMB3.8 billion for the same period last year. The change was primarily due to the 
decrease in share-based compensation expenses partially offset by the increase in amortization of intangible 
assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions related to the Tencent strategic partnership. Non-GAAP 
net loss for the first quarter of 2015 was RMB205.6 million (US$33.2 million) as compared to RMB80.1 million 
in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net margin for the first quarter of 2015 was negative 0.6% as compared 
to negative 0.4% in the first quarter of 2014. 
Net Loss Per ADS5 and Non-GAAP Net Loss Per ADS6.  Net loss per ADS for the first quarter of 2015 was 
RMB0.52 (US$0.08), compared to RMB5.80 for the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net loss per ADS for the 
first quarter of 2015 was RMB0.15 (US$0.02) as compared to RMB0.09 in the first quarter of 2014. 
Cash Flow and Working Capital 
As of March 31, 2015, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments 
totaled RMB26.8 billion (US$4.3 billion). For the first quarter of 2015, free cash flow7 was as follows:

5 Each ADS represents two class A ordinary shares. 
6 As used in this press release, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per weighted average shares is calculated by 
dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of permanent equity securities 
outstanding during the period. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) 
per weighted average shares multiplied by two. 
7 As used in this press release, non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow adding back the 
impact from internet financing activities and less capital expenditures, which include purchases of property, 
equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of office building, intangible assets 
and land use rights. 
8  Internet financing activities include financial products, primarily “Jingbaobei,” “Jingxiaodai” and “JD 
Baitiao,” the Company provides to suppliers, merchants and customers. 
9 As used in this press release, accounts payable turnover days for a given period are equal to average accounts 
payable balances at the beginning and the end of the period divided by total cost of revenues during the period

Net inventories increased to RMB13.0 billion (US$2.1 billion) as of March 31, 2015 from RMB12.2 billion as 
of December 31, 2014. Inventory turnover days10 were 35.2 days in the first quarter of 2015 and 33.1 days in

Transaction with Bitauto Holding Limited 
On January 9, 2015, the Company, Bitauto Holdings Limited and Tencent entered into a series of share 
subscription and business cooperation agreements to jointly provide enhanced online automotive transaction 
services across China, pursuant to which the Company held 15,689,443 newly issued ordinary shares of Bitauto 
upon completion of the transaction, representing approximately 25% of the outstanding ordinary shares of 
Bitauto at the time. The transaction was completed on February 16, 2015. The Company accounts for its interest 
in Bitauto using equity method of accounting and will report its interest in Bitauto one quarter in arrears, which 
will enable the Company to provide its financial disclosure independent of Bitauto's reporting schedule. Due to 
the adoption of lag reporting for the investment in Bitauto, the Company’s net loss and net loss per ADS for the 
first quarter of 2015 do not include equity income from Bitauto since the completion of the transaction. 
Second Quarter 2015 Guidance 
Net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 are expected to be between RMB43.5 billion and RMB44.5 billion, 
representing a growth rate between 52% and 56% compared with the second quarter of 2014. This forecast 
reflects JD.com's current and preliminary expectation, which is subject to change.

Non-GAAP Measures 
In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP operating 
expenses, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-
GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per weighted average shares and non-GAAP net 
income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation 
of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the 
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company defines non-GAAP operating expenses as 
operating expenses excluding share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from 
assets and business acquisitions. The Company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) as net loss excluding 
share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. 
The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adding back the impact from internet financing 
activities and less capital expenditures, which include purchases of property, equipment and software, cash paid 
for construction in progress, purchase of office building, intangible assets and land use rights. The Company 
defines non-GAAP EBITDA as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, 
depreciation and amortization. 
The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate 
operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP net 
income/(loss) enable management to assess operating results without considering the impact of share-based 
compensation and amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, which are 
non-cash charges. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into 
account the impact from internet financing activities and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment 
infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. Non-GAAP EBITDA enables 
management to assess operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation, 
depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the use of the non-
GAAP measure facilitates investors' assessment of operating performance. 
These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key 
limitations of using non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP net income/(loss) is that it does not reflect 
all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation and 
amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions have been and may continue to 
be incurred in the Company’s business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income/(loss). 
One of the key limitations of free cash flow is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for 
discretionary expenditures. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP EBITDA is that it does not reflect 
all items of income and expense that affect operations. Share-based compensation, depreciation and 
amortization have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company’s business and are not reflected in the 
presentation of non-GAAP EBITDA. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP 
information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be 
limited. 
The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest 
U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The 
Company encourages you to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single 
financial measure.
