Hangzhou, China, January 30, 2019 – Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) today announced 
its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. 
“Alibaba had another strong quarter. Our resilient operating and financial performance is a direct reflection 
of our persistent focus on better serving our growing base of nearly 700 million consumers across retail,

BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES 
Core Commerce 
 
Taobao – robust user growth and enhanced engagement.  In December 2018, our China retail 
marketplaces had 699 million mobile MAUs, representing a quarterly net increase of 33 million.  Annual 
active consumers on our China retail marketplaces was 636 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 
2018, compared to 601 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, reflecting successful user 
acquisition programs, such as referrals through the Alipay App, and is an early indicator of transaction 
activity on our platforms.  Over 70% of the increase in annual active consumers was from third-and-lower 
tier cities, demonstrating the success of our initiatives to cater to a broader base of users through simpler 
interfaces for first-time or less frequent users.  Ongoing enhancements in search and personalized 
recommendations on the Taobao App drove increased user engagement and purchase conversion. 
 
Tmall – extending B2C market leadership.  Tmall continued to extend its B2C market leadership and 
consumer wallet share.  Excluding unpaid orders, Tmall physical goods GMV grew 29% year-over-year in 
the quarter ended December 31, 2018, outpacing the industry and reflecting strong secular consumption 
trends.  This robust growth was driven by strength in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), apparel and 
home furnishing categories.   
 
Our annual 11.11 Global Shopping Festival was another record-breaking event, generating RMB213.5 billion 
in GMV settled through Alipay on our marketplaces, up 27% year-over-year.  The robust GMV growth was 
driven by an increase in the number of buyers through higher user traffic generation and improved 
conversion rates.  Over 40% of Chinese consumers on 11.11 made purchases from international brands, and 
overseas consumers from 230 countries and regions also made purchases during the festival.  This year’s 
Global Shopping Festival saw the most extensive participation and synergy creation by our business units, 
which this year went well beyond our China retail marketplaces, to encompass our offerings in online video 
entertainment, local services, cross-border e-commerce and store-based retail.  The success of the festival 
demonstrated the strength of our technology and logistics infrastructure, as well as payment and other e-
commerce ecosystem partners, operating at massive scale. 
 
 
 
3 
 
  
Tmall extended its leadership position as the engagement and distribution platform of choice in China for 
global brands.  During the quarter, brands including Valentino, Ermenegildo Zegna, Stuart Weitzman and 
Sergio Rossi opened Tmall flagship stores and joined the Tmall Luxury Pavilion. 
 
New Retail – redefining the future of brick-and-mortar.  Our New Retail strategy is transforming the 
traditional retail industry by digitizing all aspects of store-based retail operations.  We enable traditional 
retailers to deliver an unrivalled consumer experience and achieve operating efficiency through our consumer 
insight technology, on-demand delivery, inventory tracking, supply chain management and mobile payment 
solutions.  As of the end of the quarter, we have digitized approximately 470 Sun Art stores with our New 
Retail know-how and technology, enabling these stores to better manage their retail systems, while allowing 
consumers to place orders through the Taobao App and secure delivery through our on-demand delivery 
platform. 
 
Our proprietary grocery retail chain Freshippo (formerly Hema) continued to expand its footprint, optimize 
its stores and introduce new initiatives that improve customer experience.  As of December 31, 2018, there 
were 109 self-operated Freshippo stores in China, primarily located in tier 1 and tier 2 cities.  During the 
quarter, Freshippo continued to achieve robust same-store sales growth.  
 
Local consumer services – driving greater value to consumers and merchants in the local consumer 
service industry.  In December 2018, we combined our on-demand food delivery platform Ele.me with our 
restaurant and local service guide platform Koubei to create a discrete business that we call “local consumer 
services.”  This business is financed with over US$3 billion in equity capital from Alibaba, SoftBank and 
other third party investors.  During the quarter, daily on-demand orders and GMV continued to show strong 
growth.  Our local consumer services business is an important part of our consumer-facing platform, which 
leverages our 636 million annual active consumers to further penetrate the local services market, increasing 
our ability to tap into China’s ongoing consumption upgrade.  In addition, we expect that our commerce 
platform technology, know-how and infrastructure will deliver consumer insights and digitized operational 
solutions to empower local merchants on the platform. 
 
Cainiao Network – facilitating enhanced delivery experiences for the continuing consumption upgrade 
of Chinese consumers.  During the 2018 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, Cainiao processed an 
unprecedented over 1 billion delivery orders, demonstrating Cainiao’s capability to coordinate a complex 
logistics ecosystem at massive scale.  Internationally, we saw continued growth in Chinese consumer 
demand for high quality imports from Japan, the United States, South Korea, Australia and Germany – the 
top five countries selling into China during the festival.  To ensure a smooth and timely delivery experience 
for consumers during the festival, Cainiao and its partners operated 34 bonded warehouses in major ports 
throughout China to facilitate same-day or next-day delivery of overseas orders. 
 
International – building foundation for growth in Southeast Asia.  During the quarter, we emphasized 
strengthening Lazada’s third-party marketplace business, which witnessed robust growth in GMV.  At the 
same time, we reduced exposure to direct product sales in select merchandise categories, as we believe this 
strategy will best position Lazada for sustainable and scalable long-term growth.  We have upgraded 
Lazada’s technology, which resulted in robust increase in active users and greater user engagement on 
Lazada’s mobile app.  We continue to invest resources to integrate Lazada’s business and technology 
operations into Alibaba with the aim of building a strong foundation for us to extend our offerings in 
Southeast Asia. 
 
As it relates to cross-border, our priority is to meet rising demand for high-quality imported products to serve 
Chinese consumers.  At China’s inaugural Global Import Leadership Summit held in Shanghai in November, 
 
 
4 
 
  
we announced a commitment to import US$200 billion of goods from all over the world over the next five 
years.  To this end, we expect to significantly invest in our supply chain capabilities, overseas supplier 
enablement, import platform operations as well as cross-border logistics. 
 
Cloud Computing 
 
Cloud computing revenue grew 84% year-over-year to RMB6,611 million (US$962 million), primarily 
driven by increased spending from enterprise customers.  During the December 2018 quarter, Alibaba Cloud 
launched 678 new products and features, including those related to core cloud offerings, data intelligence, AI 
applications, security and enterprise solutions. 
 
In November 2018, we appointed Jeff Zhang as president of Alibaba Cloud, adding to his responsibility on 
top of his role as our Chief Technology Officer.  We believe that placing Alibaba Cloud under the leadership 
of our group’s overall technology management will enable our cloud business to leverage the best-in-class 
technology innovations of the entire group.  Under this framework, we can make available to customers of 
Alibaba Cloud much of the proprietary technology we use in our own business, such as infrastructure 
technology, data management and value-added services. 
 
Digital Media and Entertainment 
 
The synergies between our commerce and entertainment businesses continue to deliver a superior user 
experience that helps us increase paying subscribers for the Youku online video platform. During the quarter, 
Youku’s average daily subscribers increased 64% year-over-year. 
 
To more closely align the distribution business with our content strategy, during the quarter, we agreed to 
increase our stake in Alibaba Pictures to approximately 51%, subject to approval by Alibaba Pictures’ 
independent shareholders.  Upon closing, Alibaba Pictures will become our consolidated subsidiary, and our 
digital media and entertainment businesses, including Youku, Damai and Alibaba Literature, will begin to 
collaborate more closely with Alibaba Pictures.  We have also named Luyuan Fan, the Chairman and CEO of 
Alibaba Pictures, as the president of our digital media and entertainment business.  We believe increased 
alignment of strategy and management will put our digital media and entertainment business in a stronger 
position to deliver competitive offerings to consumers.  
 
Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow 
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB64,898 million 
(US$9,439 million), an increase of 17% compared to RMB55,428 million in the same quarter of 2017.  Free 
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 increased by 11% 
to RMB51,373 million (US$7,472 million), from RMB46,399 million in the same quarter of 2017.  A 
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this 
results announcement. 
Share Repurchase 
 
In September 2018, we announced an ADS repurchase plan to implement the previously announced US$6 
billion share repurchase program.  Including the repurchase of approximately 9.12 million ADSs already 
announced in our prior earnings release on November 2, 2018, we have now repurchased approximately 
10.86 million of our ADSs for a total of approximately US$1.57 billion as of January 29, 2019.

increase of 41% compared to RMB83,028 million in the same quarter of 2017.  The increase was mainly 
driven by the robust revenue growth of our China commerce retail business, the consolidation of Ele.me, as 
well as strong revenue growth of Alibaba Cloud.

Core commerce 
 China commerce retail business 
Revenue – Revenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 
2018 was RMB81,055 million (US$11,789 million), an increase of 35% compared to RMB60,105 
million in the same quarter of 2017. Revenue from our China retail marketplaces continued to see 
strong growth. Combined customer management and commission revenues grew 27% year-over-year, 
which represents an increase of 28% in customer management revenue and an increase of 24% in 
commission revenue.  The growth of customer management revenue was primarily the result of 
increases in the volume of paid clicks driven by higher click-through rate.  The growth of commission 
revenue was primarily due to strong 29% year-over-year growth of Tmall physical goods GMV 
(excluding unpaid orders).  The discrepancy of growth rates between commission revenue and Tmall 
physical goods GMV (excluding unpaid orders) is primarily due to our adoption of a new accounting 
requirement, which has the effect of spreading out recognition of revenue from annual service fees 
received from Tmall merchants, whereas we previously recognized these fees at the end of each 
 
 
8 
 
  
calendar year.  “Others” revenue was RMB11,298 million (US$1,643 million), a significant increase 
compared to RMB5,084 million in the same quarter of 2017, primarily driven by contributions from 
Freshippo, Tmall Direct Import and other direct sale businesses. 
Mobile MAUs – Mobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces grew to 699 million in December 
2018, compared to 666 million in September 2018, representing a net addition of 33 million MAUs in 
the quarter, a 21% increase from 580 million in December 2017. 
Annual active consumers – Our China retail marketplaces had 636 million annual active consumers 
for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, compared to 601 million for the 12 months ended 
September 30, 2018, representing a net addition of 35 million, and a 23% increase from 515 million 
in the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.  During the quarter, over 70% of the increase in annual 
active consumers was from third-and-lower tier cities, demonstrating the success of our initiatives to 
cater to a broader base of users through simpler interfaces for first-time or less frequent users.  The 
longer consumers have been with our platform, the more they spend and the more orders they place 
across more product categories. 
 China commerce wholesale business  
Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 
RMB2,694 million (US$392 million), an increase of 40% compared to RMB1,926 million in the 
same quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average revenue from 
paying members on 1688.com, our domestic wholesale marketplace. 
 International commerce retail business 
Revenue from our international commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 
was RMB5,834 million (US$849 million), an increase of 23% compared to RMB4,733 million in the 
same quarter of 2017.  The increase was primarily due to our consolidation of Trendyol, Turkey’s 
leading e-commerce platform.  Lazada’s revenue growth was slower than prior quarters primarily due 
to a decrease in revenue generated from our direct sales business (where revenue is recorded on a 
gross basis including the cost of inventory).  During the quarter, Lazada strengthened its core 
marketplace businesses and reduced exposure to direct sales in select merchandise categories.  This 
business model shift resulted in accelerating marketplace GMV growth, although direct sales revenue 
declined during the same period.  
 International commerce wholesale business  
Revenue from our international commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 
2018 was RMB2,175 million (US$316 million), an increase of 31% compared to RMB1,666 million 
in the same quarter of 2017.  The increase was primarily due to increases in the average revenue from 
paying members and the number of paying members on Alibaba.com, our global wholesale 
marketplace. 
 Cainiao logistics services  
Revenue from Cainiao logistics services, which represents revenue from the domestic and 
international one-stop-shop logistics services and supply chain management solutions provided by 
Cainiao Network, after elimination of inter-company transactions, was RMB4,491 million (US$653 
million), an increase of 15% compared to RMB3,907 million in the same quarter of 2017.  
 
 
9 
 
  
 Local consumer services 
Revenue from local consumer services, which primarily represents revenues from platform 
commissions, provision of food delivery services and other services provided by our on-demand food 
delivery platform Ele.me, was RMB5,159 million (US$750 million).  We started to consolidate 
Ele.me in May 2018 and Koubei in December 2018. 
Cloud computing 
Revenue from our cloud computing business in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB6,611 
million (US$962 million), an increase of 84% compared to RMB3,599 million in the same quarter of 2017, 
primarily driven by increased spending from enterprise customers. 
Digital media and entertainment 
Revenue from our digital media and entertainment business in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 
RMB6,491 million (US$944 million), an increase of 20% compared to RMB5,413 million in the same 
quarter of 2017.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from mobile value-added services 
provided by UCWeb, such as mobile search and game publishing, and an increase in subscription revenue 
from Youku. 
Innovation initiatives and others 
Revenue from innovation initiatives and others in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB1,333 
million (US$193 million), an increase of 73% compared to RMB772 million in the same quarter of 2017.  
The increase was mainly due to an increase in revenue from Tmall Genie and Amap.

Cost of revenue – Cost of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB60,813 million 
(US$8,845 million), or 52% of revenue, compared to RMB35,078 million, or 42% of revenue, in the same 
quarter of 2017. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of 
revenue would have increased from 40% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to 50% in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to (i) our consolidation of Ele.me, (ii) an increase 
of the cost of inventory and logistics from our New Retail and direct import businesses, as well as (iii) an 
increase in content spending by Youku on original content and impairment charges on licensed copyrights of 
RMB2.8 billion (US$407 million). 
Product development expenses – Product development expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 
were RMB8,901 million (US$1,295 million), or 8% of revenue, compared to RMB6,289 million, or 7% of 
revenue, in the same quarter of 2017. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product 
development expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained stable at 5% in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2018 and the same quarter last year. 
Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 
were RMB12,104 million (US$1,760 million), or 10% of revenue, compared to RMB8,542 million, or 10% 
of revenue, in the same quarter of 2017. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and 
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained stable at 10% in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2018 and the same quarter last year. 
General and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2018 were RMB5,853 million (US$851 million), or 5% of revenue, compared to RMB4,572 
million, or 6% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2017. Without the effect of share-based compensation 
expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained stable at 4% 
in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and the same quarter last year.  
Share-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the cost and 
expense items above in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB6,960 million (US$1,012 million), an 
increase of 36% compared to RMB5,115 million in the same quarter of 2017. Share-based compensation 
expense as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 6% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and the 
same quarter last year. The following table sets forth our analysis of share-based compensation expense for

Share-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees 
remained stable in this quarter compared to the previous quarter. We expect that our share-based 
compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of our shares, our 
subsidiaries’ share-based awards and the quantity of awards we grant to our employees and consultants in the 
future.  Furthermore, we expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by 
future changes in the valuation of Ant Financial, although any such changes will be non-cash and will not 
result in any economic cost or equity dilution to our shareholders. 
Amortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended December 31, 
2018 was RMB2,809 million (US$408 million), an increase of 37% from RMB2,057 million in the same 
quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets acquired from business 
combinations of Ele.me and Koubei. 
Income from operations and operating margin 
Income from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB26,798 million (US$3,898 
million), or 23% of revenue, an increase of 3% compared to RMB25,996 million, or 31% of revenue, in the 
same quarter of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to RMB40,708 million (US$5,921 million) in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2018, compared to RMB36,183 million in the same quarter of 2017.  Adjusted EBITA 
increased 9% year-over-year to RMB36,567 million (US$5,318 million) in the quarter ended December 31,

2018, compared to RMB33,662 million in the same quarter of 2017.  Reconciliations of net income to 
adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA are included at the end of this results announcement.   
Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments 
Adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments are set forth in the table below. See the section 
entitled “Information about Segments” above for a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted 
EBITA.

Core commerce segment – Adjusted EBITA increased by 20% to RMB46,079 million (US$6,702 million) 
in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to RMB38,530 million in the same quarter of 2017. 
Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA increased 31% year-over-year to RMB54,303 million 
(US$7,898 million).  Adjusted EBITA margin decreased from 53% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 
to 45% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 due to strategic investments, primarily including aggressive 
investment in local consumer services and gradual revenue mix shift towards self-operated New Retail and 
direct import businesses where revenue is recorded on a gross basis including the cost of inventory. A 
reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for core commerce to marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA 
is included at the end of this results announcement. 
We expect that our core commerce adjusted EBITA margin will continue to be affected by the pace of our 
investments in new businesses and revenue mix shift to self-operated New Retail and direct import 
businesses. 
Cloud computing segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of 
RMB274 million (US$40 million), compared to a loss of RMB181 million in the same quarter of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITA margin improved to negative 4% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 from negative 
5% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. 
Digital media and entertainment segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 
a loss of RMB6,034 million (US$878 million), compared to a loss of RMB2,213 million in the same quarter 
of 2017. Adjusted EBITA margin decreased to negative 93% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 from 
negative 41% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to our investments in the production of 
original content and licensing rights and impairment charges on licensed copyrights of RMB2.8 billion 
(US$407 million), following a regular evaluation of programming that did not generate expected returns. 
Innovation initiatives and others segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was 
a loss of RMB1,596 million (US$232 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,006 million in the same quarter 
of 2017. The increase in adjusted EBITA loss was primarily due to investments in new business initiatives, 
including Tmall Genie.

Interest and investment income, net 
Interest and investment income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB11,560 million 
(US$1,681 million), which mainly included a non-cash gain of RMB21,990 million (US$3,198 million) 
arising from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in Koubei when we obtained control in 
December 2018. The gain was partly offset by impairment charges of RMB7,059 million (US$1,026 million) 
on certain investments, as well as net loss arising from the change in fair value of certain equity investments. 
Other income (loss), net 
Other income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB387 million (US$56 million), compared 
to other loss, net of RMB348 million in the same quarter of 2017. The increase in other income was 
primarily due to a decrease in exchange loss from a loss of RMB907 million in the quarter ended December 
31, 2017 to a loss of RMB101 million (US$15 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2018.  During the 
quarter, we did not recognize any royalty fees and software technology service fees under our profit sharing 
arrangement with Ant Financial.  In the current quarter, Ant Financial continued its strategic investments to 
acquire new users and capture growth opportunities in the offline payment market.  Currently, Alipay and its 
affiliates have over 1 billion annual active users globally.  In the coming quarters, Ant Financial expects to 
continue investments aimed at capturing the strategic opportunities amid the digital transformation of 
China’s real economy. 
Income tax expenses 
Income tax expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 were RMB5,586 million (US$812 million), 
compared to RMB6,663 million in the same quarter of 2017.  
Our effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, compared to 14% in the same 
quarter of 2017. Excluding share-based compensation expense, investment gain/loss and impairment of 
investments, our effective tax rate would have been 21% in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. 
Share of results of equity investees 
Share of results of equity investees in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of RMB861 million 
(US$125 million), compared to a loss of RMB18,452 million in the same quarter of 2017.  We record our 
share of results of equity investees one quarter in arrears. Share of results of equity investees in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2018 and the comparative periods consisted of the following:

respect to Alibaba Pictures, one of our affiliated movie production businesses.   
 
Net income and Non-GAAP net income 
Our net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB30,964 million (US$4,504 million), an 
increase of 33% compared to RMB23,332 million in the same quarter of 2017.  
Excluding share-based compensation expense, non-recurring disposal gains and certain other items, non-
GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB29,797 million (US$4,334 million), an 
increase of 10% compared to RMB27,007 million in the same quarter of 2017. A reconciliation of net 
income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this results announcement.  
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders 
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB33,052 
million (US$4,807 million), an increase of 37% compared to RMB24,073 million in the same quarter of 
2017. 
Diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS  
Diluted EPS in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB12.64 (US$1.84) on a weighted average of 
2,614 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, an increase of 37% compared to RMB9.20 on a 
weighted average of 2,615 million diluted shares outstanding during the same quarter of 2017. Excluding 
share-based compensation expense, non-recurring disposal gains and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted 
EPS in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB12.19 (US$1.77), an increase of 15% compared to 
RMB10.61 in the same quarter of 2017. A reconciliation of diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS is 
included at the end of this results announcement.  
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments  
As of December 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB192,317 million 
(US$27,972 million), compared to RMB171,875 million as of September 30, 2018. The increase in cash, 
cash equivalents and short-term investments during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due 
to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB51,373 million (US$7,472 million), partly offset by cash 
used in investment and acquisition activities of RMB22,888 million (US$3,329 million) and share repurchase 
of RMB8,989 million (US$1,307 million).  Since announcing the ADS repurchase plan in September 2018, 
we have repurchased approximately 10.86 million of our ADSs for a total of approximately US$1.57 billion 
as of January 29, 2019. 
Cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB64,898 million 
(US$9,439 million), an increase of 17% compared to RMB55,428 million in the same quarter of 2017. Free 
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was RMB51,373 
million (US$7,472 million), compared to RMB46,399 million in the same quarter of 2017. A reconciliation 
of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this results 
announcement. 
 
 
15 
 
  
Net cash used in investing activities 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities of RMB31,055 million 
(US$4,517 million) primarily reflected (i) cash outflow of RMB22,888 million (US$3,329 million) for 
investment and acquisition activities, including investments in Focus Media and Tokopedia, (ii) capital 
expenditures of RMB10,100 million (US$1,469 million), which included cash outflow for acquisition of land 
use rights and construction in progress relating to office campus of RMB89 million (US$13 million), as well 
as (iii) acquisition of licensed copyrights and other intangible assets of RMB3,514 million (US$511 million). 
Employees  
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 101,550 employees, compared to 93,397 as of September 30, 
2018.  The number of employees as of December 31, 2018 increased by 8,153 from September 30, 2018, 
primarily due to our consolidation of newly acquired businesses and our expansion in local consumer 
services.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with 
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA 
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBITA (including adjusted EBITA margin), marketplace-
based core commerce adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash flow.  
For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the section entitled 
“Information about Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the 
Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” in this results announcement. 
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS 
help investors identify and understand underlying trends in our business without the effect of certain income 
or expenses that are reflected in income from operations, net income and diluted EPS.  We believe that 
 
 
17 
 
  
marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA is a measure that can help investors better understand the 
performance of our marketplace commerce business, which is the contributor of the large majority of our 
revenue.  We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted 
EPS and marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA provide useful information about our core 
operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow 
for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in our financial and operational 
decision-making.  We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to 
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic 
corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and 
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in 
isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted EPS, cash flows or 
any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance.  These non-GAAP 
financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other 
companies.  Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as 
comparative measures to our data. 
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense, 
other income (loss), net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees, and (ii) certain non-
cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation and impairment 
of goodwill, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods 
presented. 
Adjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense, 
other income (loss), net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees, and (ii) certain non-
cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of goodwill, 
which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented. 
Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA represents adjusted EBITA for core commerce 
excluding the effects of (i) local consumer services, (ii) Lazada, (iii) New Retail and direct import and (iv) 
Cainiao Network.   
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization, 
impairment of goodwill and investments, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of 
investments, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the restructuring of commercial 
arrangements with Ant Financial, immediate recognition of unamortized professional fees and upfront fees 
upon termination of bank borrowings and others, as adjusted for the tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including 
accounting for the effects of the assumed conversion of convertible preference shares. 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash 
flow statement less purchases of property and equipment, licensed copyrights and other intangible assets 
(excluding acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campus).   
The section entitled “Information about Segments” and the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP 
Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures” in this results announcement have more details on 
the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the 
related reconciliations between these financial measures.

(1) We adopted ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial 
Assets and Financial Liabilities” beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. After our adoption of this new accounting 
update, equity investments other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in the consolidation of 
the investee are required to be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the income 
statement. We have adopted this new accounting update using the modified retrospective method. For available-for-sale 
securities, RMB8,196 million in unrealized gains, net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of 
March 31, 2018 was reclassified into retained earnings upon the initial adoption as of April 1, 2018.  Investments measured 
under the cost method of RMB59,942 million as of March 31, 2018 was reclassified into investment securities as of April 1, 
2018.  The consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 was not retrospectively adjusted.

cash flows to include restricted cash and escrow receivables in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-
of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The impact of the 
retrospective reclassification on cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and effect of exchange rate changes 
for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was an increase of RMB431 million, an increase of RMB286 million and an

year 2019.  As a result of adopting this new accounting update, we retrospectively adjusted the consolidated statements of 
cash flows to include restricted cash and escrow receivables in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-
of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The impact of our 
retrospective reclassification on cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was an 
increase of RMB431 million.
