Online marketing revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were RMB12.519 billion ($2.019 
billion), representing a 33.5% increase from the corresponding period in 2014. Baidu had about 
524,000 active online marketing customers2 in the first quarter of 2015, representing a 17.5% 
increase from the corresponding period in 2014 and flat from the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter of 2015 was approximately 
RMB23,800 ($3,839), a 13.9% increase from the corresponding period in 2014 and a 9.8% 
decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
 
Traffic acquisition costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB1.722 billion ($277.7 
million), representing 13.5% of total revenues, as compared to 12.4% in the corresponding 
period in 2014 and 13.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase mainly reflects increased 
contribution of contextual ads.  
 
Bandwidth costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB849.6 million ($137.1 million), 
representing 6.7% of total revenues, compared to 6.8% in the corresponding period in 2014. 
 
Depreciation costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB582.4 million ($94.0 million), 
representing 4.6% of total revenues, compared to 4.5% in the corresponding period in 2014.  
 
Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB608.4 million ($98.1 million), 
representing 4.8% of total revenues, compared to 4.1% in the corresponding period in 2014, 
and 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was mainly due to iQiyi. 
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB2.957 billion ($477.0 million), 
representing an increase of 47.2% from the corresponding period in 2014, and a decrease of 
16.1% from the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the 
increased promotional spending for mobile products and services.  
 
Research and development expenses were RMB2.286 billion ($368.8 million), a 79.1% 
increase from the corresponding period in 2014?and an increase of 7.1% from the previous 
quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel. 
 
Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and 
expense line items, were RMB291.1 million ($47.0 million) in the first quarter of 2015, 
compared to RMB169.0 million in the corresponding period in 2014, and RMB339.0 million 
in the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase was a result of increased share grants 
to employees. 
 
Operating profit was RMB2.155 billion ($347.7 million), representing a 9.2% decrease from 
the corresponding period in 2014. Operating profit excluding share-based compensation 
                                                        
2 The number of active online marketing customers and revenue per online active customer exclude our group-buying related 
businesses for consistency with previous reporting. 
 
expenses (non-GAAP) was RMB2.446 billion ($394.6 million), a 3.8% decrease from the 
corresponding period in 2014. 
 
Income tax expense was RMB541.0 million ($87.3 million), compared to income tax expense 
of RMB430.3 million in the corresponding period in 2014. The effective tax rate for the first 
quarter of 2015 was 20.7% as compared to 15.1% for the corresponding period in 2014. The 
higher effective tax rate reflects that some loss-generating entities in the group cannot be 
consolidated for tax purposes under PRC tax law and the expiration of a preferential tax license 
for one of our subsidiaries. 
 
Net income attributable to Baidu was RMB2.449 billion ($395.1 million), representing a 3.4% 
decrease from the corresponding period in 2014. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the 
first quarter of 2015 amounted to RMB6.79 ($1.09) and RMB6.76 ($1.09), respectively. 
 
Net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses (non-
GAAP) was RMB2.740 billion ($442.1 million), a 1.3% increase from the corresponding period 
in 2014. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS excluding share-based compensation 
expenses (non-GAAP) for the first quarter of 2015 amounted to RMB7.62 ($1.23) and 
RMB7.58 ($1.22), respectively.  
 
As of March 31, 2015, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 
of RMB58.038 billion ($9.363 billion).

taxes, depreciation, amortization, other non-operating income and share-based compensation 
expenses, was RMB3.296 billion ($531.7 million) for the first quarter of 2015, representing a 
2.4% increase from the corresponding period in 2014.

billion ($2.640 billion) to RMB16.750 billion ($2.702 billion) for the second quarter of 2015,

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
To supplement Baidu’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, 
Baidu uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: 
adjusted EBITDA, operating profit excluding share-based compensation expenses, net income 
excluding share-based compensation expenses, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS 
excluding share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial 
measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial 
information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these 
non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliations of non-GAAP 
results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures” and “Reconciliation 
from net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted EBITDA” set forth at the end of this 
release.  
 
Baidu believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental 
information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses, particularly 
share-based compensation expenses, that may not be indicative of its operating performance or 
financial condition from a cash perspective. We believe that both management and investors 
benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and 
when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also 
facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Baidu’s historical performance and liquidity. 
Baidu has computed its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from 
quarter to quarter since April 1, 2006. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are 
useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental 
information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation 
of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-
based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a 
significant recurring expense in our results of operations.  A limitation of using non-GAAP 
adjusted EBITDA is that it does not include all items that impact our net income for the period. 
Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the 
GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more 
details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly 
comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures.
